Bluemix-Ionic App Base
======================

A starter project for Bluemix-Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

Make sure you have a IBM bluemix account and have registered an Mobile starter boilerplate. This is required because you need the 
route URL and the GUID of your application in Bluemix.

Once you have this replaced <APPLICATION_ROUTE> and <APPLICATION_GUID> with your own in app.js
```bash
var app = {
 route:'<APPLICATION_ROUTE>',
 guid:'<APPLICATION_GUID>'
};
```
